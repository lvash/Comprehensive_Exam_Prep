## Brent's tips

### March 9, 2017

### Exam doesn't go well when...

* When people clearly fake their way through answers   
  * Do this: "I don't know exactly, but" â€¦ take knowledge from other systems and try to apply to question

### Proposal doesn't go well when...

* Science isn't well thought out: why do we care? don't forget motivation of questions; connect motivation, questions, experimental design   

### Chalk talk (practice beforehand!)

* Think of it as an abstract for your proposal
* Motivation - what don't we know; why it's important
* Overarching Question
* Sub questions/hypotheses/predictions
* End with take home message and expectations of experiment (expected results)
