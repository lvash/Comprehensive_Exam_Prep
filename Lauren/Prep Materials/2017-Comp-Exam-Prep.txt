A viral species was formally defined by van Regenmortel as ‘.a polythetic class of viruses that constitutes a replicating lineage and occupies a particular ecological niche’ (van Regenmortel 1990).

The family Iridoviridae currently contains five genera, two of which infect invertebrates (Iridovirus and Chloriridovirus) and three that infect only ectother- mic vertebrates (Lymphocystivirus, Megalocytivirus, and Ranavirus; Lymphocystiviruses and megalocytiviruses only infect fish, whereas, as indicated above, ranaviruses target fish, amphibians, and reptiles

As discussed in Brunner et al. (2015), some hosts function as reser- voirs for the virus and maintain subclinical infections resulting in low population prevalence, while other species serve as amplification hosts and initiate outbreaks.

For example, Brenes et al. (2014a, b) conservatively declared a positive result if the Ct value was less than the lower bound of a 95 % confidence interval at a predicted virus quantity of zero. 

 Caution must be exercised when interpreting high Ct values (e.g., Ct values >35), because they can represent amplification or fluorescence artifacts, or cross-contamination (Caraguel et al. 2011).
 
 Several validated methods that incorporate automated, semi-automated, and manual homogenization of tissues have been described and compare the extraction efficiencies of ranavirus from tissues (Whittington and Steiner 1993; Rimmer et al. 2012). Extraction efficiency is especially important if viral loads are low in tissues, such as in subclinical infections.
