Questions for dissertation:

QII
- Does species richness differ in sites with disease compared to without? Does it change after ‘outbreak’ (increased prevalence)?
- Are certain species associated with diseased sites?
- Does viral load differ between positive sites?
- Are there genetic diversity differences?

QIII
- Can we detect ranavirus in the environment (eDNA)
- Can modeling better elucidate transmission?
- Trade off in virulence experiment? 
- Experimental evolution with bacteriophages (host switching?) – Dr. Goodnight; Brent/Melissa; Brandon
- Transmission probabilities between species: network analysis?

QIV
-	Does mortality/fitness change with multiple stressors and at different life stages?
-	If there are any that are asymptomatic – are they differentially expressing genes?
-	Are the survivors differentially expressing genes?
-	There are adaptive alleles: allelic shifts as summer passes/infection prevalence increases?


QII background
- Genetic diversity in general? In system?
- Disease severity/mortality and viral load are correlated (find reference)
- Variance in virulence
- Most susceptible species (wood frogs)?
- How does question relate to big picture? How does approach relate to question?
- Brenes 2013: community-level mortality was higher if it was composed only of one highly susceptible species (p88)
“Hotspot versus dilution” 

QIII
- Does ranavirus have same 'efficiency' across species?
