## Proposal meet up

### February 2, 2017



**What we know**:

* Proposal is NSF style 5-10 pages
* Gotelli has BCOR 102 word lists
* Ask committee members what they expect from you
* Ask graduate students about their experiences
* Meet with your advisor for class and others for help
* Usually ~1 paper per dissertation chapter (good to say how many and which publications can come from this research)
  ​

**Katie's insight**

After you are done writing your proposal, allow time between that and the verbal part, 2-3 weeks was not enough. Broader associations of your research. What are your main questions and every aspect of your system they could ask you about? How does it interact with environment? Okay to 'not know' as long as it's not too much. They try to work you through the answer (you can ask questions back). More time would have been nice: at least a month. Knowing the finer details is good, but need broader. Talk as much as possible. 

**For next week:** 

- Every one asks someone for a proposal 
- Emily and April send their proposal overviews
